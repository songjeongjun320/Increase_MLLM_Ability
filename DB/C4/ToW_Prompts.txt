##Prompt for Thought Generation ##
Task Instruction: Given certain text, you need to predict the next
word of it. Moreover, before your output, you could first give short
thoughts about how you infer the next word based on the provided
context.
Here are five examples for the task:
Example 0: {<ex0>}
Example 1: {<ex1>}
Example 2: {<ex2>}
Example 3: {<ex3>}
Example 4: {<ex4>}
Now please give me your prediction for the thought and next word
based on the following context:
{<context>}
Thought:
Next Word:

 
## Prompt for Consistency Check ##
Task Instruction: Given the following certain text, thought for its
next word and the gold next word, you need to judge whether the
thought for generating the next word is consistent based on the
reasoning process and the given text. For consistency, we mean that
the thought only needs to generally entail the gold next word in
reasoning and does NOT need to be specific on the gold next words.
Context: {"드라이브 복제는 먼저 부팅 가능한 Apple 등과 같은 "}
Thought: {"The context states \"드라이브 복제는 먼저 부팅 가능한 Apple 등과 같은 \" which translates to \"Drive cloning first [is done by/starts with] a bootable [something] such as Apple's, etc.\". The phrase \"부팅 가능한\" (bootable) modifies the noun to be predicted. \"Apple 등과 같은\" (such as Apple's, or similar to Apple's) further specifies this noun. In the context of Apple systems and drive cloning, a common bootable medium is an installation disk (or USB drive, which is a type of disk) or a recovery disk. Therefore, \"디스크\" (disk) is a logical completion, referring to a bootable disk like an Apple-provided one (e.g., macOS installer) or similar."}
Gold Next Word: {"방식으로"}
Now please give me your single reasoning and judgement, i.e. True or
False, for the consistency of thought and gold next word based on
the above information.
Reasoning: Let’s think step by step.
Judgement:
