# Thoughts of Words (ToW) Research Project - Complete File Description

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a comprehensive research project implementing **Thoughts of Words (ToW)** methodology to improve multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) accuracy. The core innovation uses English as a cognitive intermediary during reasoning to enhance output quality in non-English languages, addressing the prevalent English-centric bias in current LLMs.

**Research Goal**: Bridge the AI divide by ensuring equitable access to high-quality AI services across languages through improved multilingual accuracy.
