This document establishes a rigorous statistical evaluation methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the Thoughts of Words (ToW) approach in addressing English-centric bias in multilingual Large Language Models. The framework ensures scientific rigor through appropriate statistical testing, effect size calculations, and reproducible experimental design.

## 1. Statistical Framework Foundation

### 1.1 Core Research Hypotheses

#### Primary Hypotheses
**H₁ (Main Effect)**: ToW methodology significantly improves multilingual task performance compared to baseline models
- **H₁₀**: μ_ToW = μ_baseline (null hypothesis)
- **H₁ₐ**: μ_ToW > μ_baseline (alternative hypothesis)

**H₂ (Language Equity)**: ToW reduces performance disparity between high-resource and low-resource languages
- **H₂₀**: (μ_high - μ_low)_ToW = (μ_high - μ_low)_baseline
- **H₂ₐ**: (μ_high - μ_low)_ToW < (μ_high - μ_low)_baseline

**H₃ (Cultural Appropriateness)**: ToW maintains or improves cultural appropriateness in multilingual outputs
- **H₃₀**: μ_cultural_ToW = μ_cultural_baseline
- **H₃ₐ**: μ_cultural_ToW > μ_cultural_baseline

#### Secondary Hypotheses
**H₄ (Thought Quality)**: Higher thought quality correlates with better output quality
**H₅ (Cross-lingual Transfer)**: ToW enables effective cross-lingual reasoning transfer
**H₆ (Scalability)**: ToW effectiveness scales across different model sizes and architectures

### 1.2 Statistical Power and Sample Size

#### Power Analysis Framework
- **Desired Power (1-β)**: 0.80 (80% probability of detecting true effects)
- **Significance Level (α)**: 0.05 (5% Type I error rate)
- **Expected Effect Size**: Cohen's d = 0.5 (medium effect)
- **Multiple Comparison Correction**: Bonferroni or FDR adjustment

#### Sample Size Calculations

**For Between-Group Comparisons**:
```
n = 2 × (z_α/2 + z_β)² × σ² / δ²
Where:
