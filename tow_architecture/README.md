# Thoughts of Words (ToW) Architecture

A comprehensive AI architecture for improving multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) accuracy through English intermediary reasoning. The ToW system enables models to perform cognitive bridging between English reasoning and target language output, addressing the English-centric bias in current LLMs.

## 🎯 Overview

The Thoughts of Words (ToW) architecture addresses the critical challenge of English-centric bias in Large Language Models by introducing an innovative cognitive bridging approach:

1. **English Intermediary Reasoning**: Generate explicit English "thought tokens" that capture reasoning processes
2. **Cognitive Bridging**: Map English thoughts to target language concepts with cultural adaptation
3. **Multilingual Output**: Generate accurate, culturally appropriate output in the target language
4. **Quality Validation**: Assess output quality, coherence, and thought alignment

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Core Components

- **ToWEngine**: Main orchestration system coordinating the entire pipeline
- **CognitiveBridge**: Cross-lingual reasoning coordination with cultural adaptation
- **ThoughtTokenProcessor**: English thought token generation and management
- **MultilingualProcessor**: Target language output generation with style adaptation

### Model Adapters

- **DeepSeekAdapter**: Specialized support for DeepSeek models with thinking mode
- **LlamaAdapter**: Optimized interface for Llama model family
- **QwenAdapter**: Tailored support for Qwen models
- **ModelAdapterFactory**: Unified model creation and optimization

### Supporting Systems

- **Evaluation Framework**: Multilingual accuracy assessment and benchmarking
- **Training Pipeline**: Fine-tuning and adaptation for ToW-enhanced models
- **Configuration Management**: Comprehensive system configuration
- **Utilities**: Logging, memory management, and text processing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```python
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd tow_architecture

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from tow_architecture import ToWEngine
from tow_architecture.models import ModelAdapterFactory
from tow_architecture.core import ToWRequest

# Create model adapter
adapter = ModelAdapterFactory.create_and_load(
    model_path="/path/to/your/model",
    model_type="deepseek",
    quantization="4bit"
)

# Initialize ToW Engine
tow_engine = ToWEngine(model_adapter=adapter)

# Create request
request = ToWRequest(
    text="The weather is beautiful today",
    target_language="ko",  # Korean
    task_type="translation"
)

# Process with ToW
response = tow_engine.process(request)

print(f"Thoughts: {response.thought_tokens}")
print(f"Output: {response.output_text}")
print(f"Confidence: {response.confidence_score}")
```

## 🧠 How ToW Works

### 1. Input Analysis
```python
# Analyze input for language, complexity, and requirements
analysis = {
    "detected_language": "en",
    "complexity_score": 0.6,
    "task_requirements": {"requires_accuracy": True}
}
```

### 2. Thought Generation
```python
# Generate English reasoning tokens
thoughts = [
    "The input describes positive weather conditions",
    "Korean translation requires appropriate formality level", 
    "Cultural adaptation needed for weather expressions"
]
```

### 3. Cognitive Bridging
```python
# Bridge English thoughts to target language concepts
bridge_result = {
    "bridged_thoughts": ["날씨에 대한 긍정적 표현", "격식 수준 고려"],
    "cultural_adaptations": ["formal_register", "weather_idioms"],
    "semantic_mapping": {"beautiful": "아름다운/좋은"}
}
```

### 4. Multilingual Output
```python
# Generate culturally appropriate target language output
output = "오늘 날씨가 정말 좋네요"  # Korean with appropriate formality
```
