"""
Model Adapters - Unified Interface for Different LLM Backends
============================================================

This module provides unified interfaces for different large language models,
including DeepSeek, Llama, and Qwen. Each adapter implements the BaseModelAdapter
interface to ensure consistent behavior across different model architectures.
